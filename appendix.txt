In this all project, I used cursor for code completion(auto filling) and claude.ai for last minutes help on the generate of Quarto Book(as well as grammarly for grammar check)


Screenshot 20250811 at 22.37.12.png
why the reference is not shown here date: today
 chapters:
 - index.qmd
 - report/01-question.qmd
 - report/02-import.qmd
 - report/03-tidy.qmd
 - report/04-transform.qmd
 - report/05-visualize.qmd
 - report/06-model.qmd
 - report/07-communicate.qmd
 - report/references.bib
Edit
Looking at your Quarto project configuration, the issue is that you're listing report/references.bib in the chapters section, but .bib files are bibliography files, not chapters to be rendered.
Here's what's happening:
Bibliography files (.bib) are not chapters - They contain reference data in BibTeX format, not content to be rendered as part of your book.
Quarto handles bibliography automatically - When you have citations in your .qmd files (using @cite-key syntax), Quarto will automatically generate a references section.
To fix this, you should:
Remove the references.bib from chapters:
yaml
chapters:
  - index.qmd
  - report/01-question.qmd
  - report/02-import.qmd
  - report/03-tidy.qmd
  - report/04-transform.qmd
  - report/05-visualize.qmd
  - report/06-model.qmd
  - report/07-communicate.qmd
  # Remove this line: - report/references.bib
Add bibliography configuration instead:
yaml
project:
  type: book
  title: "Tennis Match Prediction Analysis"

book:
  title: "Tennis Match Prediction Analysis"
  subtitle: "STAT 468 Final Project"
  author: "Chongzhi Fu"
  date: today
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - report/01-question.qmd
    - report/02-import.qmd
    - report/03-tidy.qmd
    - report/04-transform.qmd
    - report/05-visualize.qmd
    - report/06-model.qmd
    - report/07-communicate.qmd

bibliography: report/references.bib  # Add this line

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
This way, Quarto will:
Use your references.bib file for citations
Automatically generate a "References" section at the end of your book
Not try to render the .bib file as a chapter



after i making this change, the .bib is still not appear in it, tell me why
Edit
After making the bibliography configuration change, the references still might not appear for several reasons. Here are the most common causes and solutions:
1. No Citations in Your Documents
The most common reason - Quarto only generates a references section if you actually cite sources in your .qmd files.
Check if you have citations like:
markdown
According to @smith2020, tennis prediction models...
This approach has been validated [@jones2019; @davis2021].
If you have no citations, add some to test:
markdown
# In one of your .qmd files
This is based on recent research [@your-citation-key].
2. Bibliography Path Issue
Make sure the path to your .bib file is correct relative to your _quarto.yml file.
If your structure is:
project/
├── _quarto.yml
└── report/
    └── references.bib
Then use: bibliography: report/references.bib
If your structure is:
project/
├── _quarto.yml
└── references.bib
Then use: bibliography: references.bib
3. Invalid BibTeX Format
Check that your references.bib file has valid BibTeX entries:
bibtex
@article{smith2020,
  title={Tennis Match Prediction},
  author={Smith, John},
  journal={Sports Analytics},
  year={2020}
}
4. Force References to Appear
If you want references to show even without citations, add this to the end of your last chapter (usually 07-communicate.qmd):
markdown
# References

::: {#refs}
:::
5. Check Your Current Setup
Can you show me:
Your current _quarto.yml file
A sample from your references.bib file
Whether you have any @citation-key references in your .qmd files
This will help me pinpoint exactly why the references aren't appearing.

Edit
Your BibTeX file looks correct. The references aren't appearing because you need to actually cite them in your .qmd files. Quarto only generates a references section when you use citations.
Here's how to fix it:
1. Add Citations to Your Documents
In your .qmd files, add citations using the @ symbol followed by the citation key. For example:
In your data import section (02-import.qmd):
markdown
The ATP tennis data was obtained from @sackmann_tennis_atp, which provides comprehensive rankings, results, and statistics.
In your methodology section (06-model.qmd):
markdown
Previous research on tennis prediction includes @kovalchik2016searching and @barnett2005combining, who developed methods for combining player statistics.
In your communication section (07-communicate.qmd):
markdown
This analysis was conducted using @quarto for reproducible research and @scikit_learn for machine learning implementations.
2. Force References Section to Appear
Add this to the end of your last chapter (07-communicate.qmd):
markdown
# References

::: {#refs}
:::
3. Multiple Citation Formats
You can cite multiple sources:
markdown
Tennis prediction models have been explored [@kovalchik2016searching; @barnett2005combining; @ma2013comprehensive].
4. Test with a Simple Citation
To quickly test, add this line anywhere in one of your .qmd files:
markdown
This project uses data from @sackmann_tennis_atp.
Then render your book again. You should see:
The citation appears in the text as "(Sackmann 2024)" or similar
A "References" section appears at the end with the full bibliography entry
The key point: Quarto only includes references that are actually cited in your text. Your .bib file is just a database - you need to "activate" entries by citing them with @citation-key in your documents.



change it for me # Import 
After switching from my original fatigue analysis idea to match outcome prediction, I needed 
to find good tennis data that would actually work for this project. During my earlier paper 
presentation research, I had discovered Jeff Sackmann's tennis datasets on GitHub, which 
turned out to be exactly what I needed. Jeff is well-known in the tennis analytics community 
and maintains a comprehensive repository of ATP match data that spans decades.
The dataset contains detailed information about professional tennis matches including player 
names, rankings, tournament details, court surfaces, and match outcomes. I decided to focus 
on ATP men's tennis data from 2022 to 2024, which gave me recent matches that reflect current 
playing styles while providing enough data to train a reliable model.
When I first loaded the data, I was looking at almost 66,000 matches total, which seemed 
impressive until I realized most of it wasn't useful for my project. The older data had 
missing information everywhere, and honestly, tennis from the 1970s isn't very relevant for 
predicting modern matches anyway. The dataset also had plenty of messy real-world issues like 
missing rankings, incomplete matches, and various data entry inconsistencies that I had to 
deal with.
I implemented a straightforward filtering approach to get clean, usable data. First, I limited 
everything to 2022-2024 matches to keep it current. Then I removed any matches where players 
didn't have official ATP rankings, since rankings are the core feature my model relies on. 
I also focused only on matches between players ranked in the top 300, because lower-ranked 
players tend to be very inconsistent and would just add noise to the model.
```python
import pandas as pd
def clean_tennis_data(df):
   df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])
   df['Year'] = df['Date'].dt.year
   recent_data = df[df['Year'].isin([2022, 2023, 2024])]
   ranked_matches = recent_data[
       (recent_data['Rank_1'] != -1) & (recent_data['Rank_2'] != -1)
   ]
   top_tier = ranked_matches[
       (ranked_matches['Rank_1'] <= 300) & (ranked_matches['Rank_2'] <= 300)
   ]
   complete_matches = top_tier[
       ~top_tier['Score'].str.contains('RET|W/O', na=False)
   ]
   return complete_matches
clean_df = clean_tennis_data(df)
print(f"Clean matches: {len(clean_df):,}")
```
Finally, I removed matches that ended in retirements or walkovers since these don't represent
normal competitive outcomes. After all this filtering, I went from 66,000 matches down to
about 4,500 high-quality recent matches between established players.
The final dataset contained exactly what I needed for prediction: player rankings for both
competitors, court surface information (hard, clay, or grass), and clear match outcomes. While
I threw away a lot of data in the cleaning process, having a smaller dataset with reliable,
consistent information turned out to be much more valuable than having tons of messy historical
data.
This approach gave me confidence that the model would be training on meaningful patterns rather
than trying to learn from inconsistent or irrelevant information. The focus on recent data from
established players created a solid foundation for building a prediction system that would
actually work in practice.

Here's your import section with proper citations added:

Key change: I added the citation [@sackmann_tennis_atp] when you first mention Jeff Sackmann's dataset. Now when you render your Quarto book, this will:
Show up as a proper citation in the text (like "Sackmann (2024)" or similar)
Include the full reference in your References section at the end
You can add more citations throughout your other chapters as needed. For example, in your modeling section, you might cite @scikit_learn when discussing machine learning, or @kovalchik2016searching and @barnett2005combining when discussing previous tennis prediction research.



# Model
With a cleaned dataset and clear understanding of the patterns, I moved into the modeling 
phase. The goal was straightforward: predict the winner of a men's ATP match using player 
rankings and surface type. Since the outcome is binary - Player 1 wins or loses - logistic 
regression was the natural choice. It's interpretable, efficient, and works well when you 
have a clear understanding of what features matter.
The final dataset contained about 4,500 high-quality matches after all the filtering. I 
used five key features: ranking advantage (Player 2's rank minus Player 1's rank), whether 
there's a large ranking gap, surface indicators for clay and grass courts, and a flag for 
whether Player 1 is higher ranked.
I split the data using the standard 80-20 approach, training on most matches while keeping 
some aside to test how well the model performs on unseen data. The training process was 
straightforward - logistic regression finds the best way to combine the features to predict 
match outcomes.
The results were encouraging. Training accuracy came in at around 63%, with test accuracy 
almost identical at 62-63%. While this isn't perfect, it's notably better than random 
guessing and aligns well with what published tennis research has achieved. The fact that 
training and test scores were so close suggests the model learned genuine patterns rather 
than just memorizing the training data.
Looking at what the model actually learned was fascinating. The ranking advantage feature 
had by far the biggest coefficient, confirming that relative player strength drives most 
outcomes. Large ranking gaps added extra predictive power, while surface effects were real 
but small. Clay courts slightly favored upsets, while grass was a bit more predictable.
I tested the model with some example predictions to make sure it behaved sensibly. A rank 5 
player against rank 25 on hard court got about 70% win probability. Rank 1 versus rank 100 
jumped to over 90%. These numbers match tennis intuition - bigger gaps mean more predictable 
outcomes, with surface making small adjustments.
The trained model was saved in multiple formats to make deployment easier. This allowed me 
to load it directly into the web application and serve real-time predictions. The whole 
pipeline from raw match data to interactive predictions was now complete.
What impressed me most was how well this simple approach worked. Instead of complex feature 
engineering or fancy algorithms, focusing on the fundamentals - who's better and where 
they're playing - captured most of what determines tennis match outcomes. Sometimes the 
best solution really is the simplest one that actually works.

i have more than that it only appears the last few
Edit
The issue is that Quarto only includes references in the bibliography that are actually cited in your text. You have 15 references in your .bib file, but only 4 are showing up because you've only cited those 4 in your documents.
Here are your options:
Option 1: Add More Citations (Recommended)
Go through your chapters and add citations where relevant. For example:
In your communication/deployment section:
markdown
The web application was built using @fastapi for the backend API and @shiny_python for the interactive interface. The system is deployed on @aws_ec2 instances with data stored in @aws_s3, using @docker for containerization and @github_actions for automated deployment.
In your methodology section:
markdown
This analysis was conducted using @quarto for reproducible research documentation and @cursor for development.
When discussing your deployment:
markdown
The interactive application is hosted on @shinyapps_io, making it accessible to tennis fans and analysts.
Option 2: Force All References to Appear
If you want ALL references to show regardless of citations, add this to the end of your last chapter:
markdown
# References

::: {#refs}
:::

---

## Additional Resources

@tennis_match_charting
@fastapi  
@shiny_python
@aws_s3
@aws_ec2
@docker
@github_actions
@shinyapps_io
@quarto
@cursor

---
Option 3: Use nocite in YAML
Add this to your _quarto.yml:
yaml
bibliography: report/references.bib
nocite: |
  @*
This will include ALL references from your .bib file, even uncited ones.
I recommend Option 1 - adding proper citations where they make sense in your text. This creates a more professional document and helps readers understand what tools and research informed your work.



Screenshot 20250811 at 22.50.00.png
it's now appear on the last page, how could i make it to a new page using option 3
Edit
To make the References section appear on a new page when using option 3 (nocite: |), you can add a page break before the references section. Here are a few ways to do this:
Method 1: Add to your last chapter file
At the end of your last chapter (probably 07-communicate.qmd), add:
markdown
{{< pagebreak >}}

# References

::: {#refs}
:::
Method 2: Create a separate references file
Create a new file called references.qmd in your report folder with this content:
markdown
{{< pagebreak >}}

# References

::: {#refs}
:::
Then update your _quarto.yml to include it:
yaml
book:
  title: "Tennis Match Prediction Analysis"
  subtitle: "STAT 468 Final Project"
  author: "Chongzhi Fu"
  date: today
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - report/01-question.qmd
    - report/02-import.qmd
    - report/03-tidy.qmd
    - report/04-transform.qmd
    - report/05-visualize.qmd
    - report/06-model.qmd
    - report/07-communicate.qmd
    - report/references.qmd  # Add this line

bibliography: report/references.bib
nocite: |
  @*
Method 3: Alternative page break syntax
If {{< pagebreak >}} doesn't work, try:
markdown
\newpage

# References

::: {#refs}
:::
I recommend Method 2 - creating a separate references.qmd file. This keeps your content organized and makes it clear that references are their own section.
The {{< pagebreak >}} directive tells Quarto to start a new page before the References section, which should solve your formatting issue.



Screenshot 20250811 at 22.52.19.png
it's still on page 8, i want it on page 9
Edit
To force the References section to start on a new page (page 9), you need to add a page break before it. Here's how to fix this:
Method 1: Add page break to your last chapter
At the very end of your 07-communicate.qmd file, add:
markdown
repository, it automatically rebuilds and redeploys everything. The final web application is deployed on
shinyapps.io, making it accessible to anyone with an internet connection.

Users can visit the site, select players like Djokovic versus Alcaraz on clay court, and see that the model
predicts specific win probabilities. The interface also shows API connection status, so users know whether
they're getting predictions from the live machine learning model or a fallback calculation.

This end-to-end system demonstrates how modern data science projects go beyond just building models.
The real value comes from making predictions accessible to people who can use them, whether tennis
fans or analysts. By combining cloud storage, API services, and interactive web applications, the project
shows how academic research can be transformed into practical tools that people actually want to use.

{{< pagebreak >}}
Method 2: Create a separate references.qmd file
Create a new file report/references.qmd:
markdown
{{< pagebreak >}}

# References

::: {#refs}
:::
Then update your _quarto.yml:
yaml
chapters:
  - index.qmd
  - report/01-question.qmd
  - report/02-import.qmd
  - report/03-tidy.qmd
  - report/04-transform.qmd
  - report/05-visualize.qmd
  - report/06-model.qmd
  - report/07-communicate.qmd
  - report/references.qmd  # Add this line
Method 3: Alternative page break syntax
If {{< pagebreak >}} doesn't work, try using LaTeX syntax:
markdown
\newpage

# References
The {{< pagebreak >}} directive should force Quarto to start the References section on page 9. Make sure to add it right before where you want the page break to occur.

for the 5 Visualize, how could we insert a png into it , it called tennis_analysis.png# Visualize
With my features ready, I needed to step back and actually look at the data to make sure 
everything made sense before building a model. The goal wasn't to find fancy hidden patterns, 
but to confirm that the basic tennis logic I was counting on actually showed up in the data.
I focused on four simple charts that would tell me whether my approach was on the right track. 
The most important was plotting win rates against ranking differences. This would show whether 
bigger ranking gaps actually led to more predictable outcomes, which is the core assumption 
my entire model relies on.
What I found was exactly what I hoped to see: a smooth curve where matches between similarly 
ranked players were basically coin flips, but as the ranking gap widened, the higher-ranked 
player won more and more often. When there was a 50-point ranking difference, the favorite 
won about 75% of the time. This gave me confidence that ranking difference would be a strong 
predictor.
The surface analysis was interesting too. Hard courts, clay courts, and grass showed small 
but consistent differences in upset rates. Clay had slightly more surprises, which matches 
what tennis fans know - the slower surface gives defensive players more chances to turn 
matches around. But the differences were modest, confirming that surface should be a 
supporting feature rather than the main driver.
I also checked the distribution of player rankings in my dataset. Most matches involved 
players ranked in the top 100, which made sense since these players compete more frequently 
in the tournaments that get recorded. This skew toward better players was actually good for 
my model since it meant I was training on consistent, high-quality tennis rather than trying 
to learn from erratic lower-level matches.
Finally, I looked at how many matches I had from each year. The data was fairly balanced 
across 2022, 2023, and 2024, which meant I wouldn't have weird seasonal biases affecting 
my results. Tennis changes slowly enough that three years of data should capture stable 
patterns without getting too stale.
The visualization process confirmed three key insights that shaped my modeling approach. 
First, ranking difference really is the dominant factor in tennis outcomes. Second, surface 
effects exist but are secondary to player quality. Third, my dataset was clean and balanced 
enough to train a reliable model without worrying about major biases or data quality issues.
These charts became part of my final report because they clearly demonstrate that the model 
is built on sound tennis logic rather than just mathematical optimization. Being able to 
show that the data behaves the way tennis experts would expect gives credibility to the 
predictions the model eventually makes.
Edit
Looking at your "Visualize" section, there are several natural places where you could insert the tennis_analysis.png image to enhance the narrative. Here are the best options:
Option 1: After the core finding paragraph
Insert the image right after this sentence: "When there was a 50-point ranking difference, the favorite won about 75% of the time. This gave me confidence that ranking difference would be a strong predictor."
This would work well if your PNG shows the win rate vs ranking difference curve you described.
Option 2: After describing all four analyses
Place it after: "The data was fairly balanced across 2022, 2023, and 2024, which meant I wouldn't have seasonal biases affecting my results."
This works if your image is a multi-panel figure showing all the different visualizations you created.
Option 3: Before the insights summary
Insert it just before: "The visualization process confirmed three key insights..."
This creates a nice flow where you describe your analysis, show the visual evidence, then summarize what it means.
Option 4: At the very end
Place it after the final sentence as supporting evidence for your conclusion that the charts "clearly demonstrate that the model is built on sound tennis logic."
My recommendation would be Option 1 - right after describing the ranking difference finding - since that seems to be your most important discovery and likely what the main chart in your PNG displays. This placement reinforces your key insight immediately with visual evidence.
What does your tennis_analysis.png actually show? That would help determine the most logical placement.



i need to insert the graph into it, how can i do that in a qmd file
Edit
In a Quarto markdown (.qmd) file, you can insert your PNG image using several methods:
Method 1: Simple Markdown Syntax
markdown
![Caption text](tennis_analysis.png)
Method 2: With size control and alignment
markdown
![Win rates vs ranking difference](tennis_analysis.png){width=80% fig-align="center"}
Method 3: Using HTML for more control
html
<img src="tennis_analysis.png" alt="Tennis Analysis Visualization" width="600" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
Method 4: Quarto figure block (recommended)
markdown
::: {#fig-tennis}
![Win rates vs ranking difference showing the relationship between player ranking gaps and match outcomes](tennis_analysis.png)

Tennis match outcome analysis
:::
Method 5: With figure referencing
markdown
![Win rates vs ranking difference](tennis_analysis.png){#fig-tennis-analysis width=70% fig-align="center"}

As shown in @fig-tennis-analysis, the ranking difference clearly predicts match outcomes.
For your specific text, I'd recommend:
Insert this after the sentence about the 50-point ranking difference:
markdown
When there was a 50-point ranking difference, the favorite won about 75% of the time. This gave me confidence that ranking difference would be a strong predictor.

![Tennis match analysis showing win rates across different ranking differences and surface types](tennis_analysis.png){width=80% fig-align="center"}

The surface analysis was interesting too...
Make sure your tennis_analysis.png file is in the same directory as your .qmd file, or adjust the path accordingly (e.g., images/tennis_analysis.png if it's in an images folder).

Great! The GitHub Action is running but failing due to a deprecated version issue. The error shows that actions/upload-pages-artifact: v3 is deprecated. Let's fix this by updating the workflow to use the newer versions:

git add .github/workflows/quarto-publish.yml

# Commit the fix
git commit -m "Update GitHub Actions workflow to use newer action versions"

# Push to trigger a new build
git push origin main
After pushing, the GitHub Action should run again with the updated versions. You can monitor it in the Actions tab. The key changes:

Updated actions/configure-pages from v3 to v4
Updated actions/deploy-pages from v2 to v4
Kept actions/upload-pages-artifact at v3 (this is the current stable version)

This should resolve the deprecation error and allow your Quarto book to deploy successfully to GitHub Pages!RetryCFwhat should i do in the github pages?EditGreat question! Let's set up GitHub Pages properly. Here's what you need to do:
Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

Go to your repository: https://github.com/fcz1214/stat468-finalproject
Click on "Settings" (in the top navigation bar of your repo)
Scroll down to "Pages" (in the left sidebar menu)
Configure the Source:

Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")
This tells GitHub to use your workflow file to build and deploy


Click "Save" if there's a save button

Step 2: Verify the Setup
After enabling GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions as the source, you should see:

A message saying "Your site is being built from GitHub Actions"
Eventually, a green checkmark and URL when it's ready

Step 3: Monitor the Deployment

Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
Watch the workflow run - it should show "Render and Deploy Quarto Project"
Wait for it to complete (should turn green ✅)

Step 4: Access Your Published Site
Once the GitHub Action completes successfully, your report will be available at:
https://fcz1214.github.io/stat468-finalproject/
What Should Happen

GitHub Actions will automatically build your Quarto book every time you push changes
Your report will be converted into a professional website with navigation
Each chapter will be a separate page with a table of contents
The site will be publicly accessible via the GitHub Pages URL

If It's Still Not Working
If you don't see the "GitHub Actions" option in Pages settings:

Make sure your repository is public (not private)
Try refreshing the Settings page
Make sure you're in the right repository

# Tennis Match Prediction Analysis

## Abstract

This project began with an ambitious goal to analyze player fatigue patterns during tennis rallies by examining how shot speeds decline as rallies extend. The original plan was to use detailed shot-by-shot data from the Tennis Match Charting Project to understand when and how players tire during long exchanges, potentially revealing insights about momentum shifts and optimal rest strategies.

However, after diving into the data and conducting initial exploratory analysis, it became clear that the relationship between shot speed degradation and match outcomes was much weaker than anticipated. The data showed inconsistent patterns across different players and court surfaces, making it difficult to build a reliable predictive model. Rather than forcing a problematic approach, I decided to pivot to a more established and proven methodology.

Earlier in the course, I had presented a paper on tennis match prediction that used fundamental player characteristics like rankings and match context to predict winners. This presentation had given me a solid theoretical foundation and highlighted the effectiveness of simpler approaches in sports prediction. Given the computational constraints of this project and the need for reliable results, replicating and extending this research seemed like a much more practical and achievable direction.

The current project focuses on predicting tennis match outcomes using core features that have been proven effective in academic research. Instead of complex shot-level analysis, this approach relies on ATP player rankings, ranking differences between opponents, and court surface information. While this might seem simpler than the original fatigue analysis, it actually represents a more robust and scientifically grounded approach to tennis prediction.

The methodology centers around logistic regression models that balance prediction accuracy with computational efficiency. Using ATP tournament data from 2022 to 2024, the system processes match information for top-ranked players and generates real-time predictions. This approach has been validated in multiple academic studies and consistently delivers reliable results in the 65-70% accuracy range.

What makes this project unique is not just the prediction model itself, but the complete end-to-end implementation. The system demonstrates how academic research can be translated into practical applications. Starting with raw tournament data, the pipeline includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and ultimately deployment as a web application that anyone can use to get match predictions.

The technical architecture showcases modern data science practices, including API development using FastAPI, cloud deployment on AWS EC2, and an interactive web interface built with Python Shiny. The entire system is automated using GitHub Actions, ensuring reproducibility and easy updates as new data becomes available.

This project serves multiple purposes. It validates existing tennis prediction research by successfully replicating published methodologies. It demonstrates how to adapt academic approaches for real-world constraints like limited computing power. Most importantly, it shows the complete journey from research paper to deployed application, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation.

The final result is a working tennis prediction system that not only achieves competitive accuracy but also provides a template for how sports analytics research can be transformed into accessible tools for fans, analysts, and researchers.

Step 5: Commit and push
bash# Add all the files
git add .

git commit -m "Add missing index.qmd file at root level"

# Push to trigger another build
git push origin main
The issue was that your index.qmd file was missing from the root directory, but your _quarto.yml was trying to reference it. This should fix the build error!RetryCFyou remember we put the index.qmd under the report and do we have to move to the main file?EditYou're absolutely right! I remember now - you have index.qmd in the report directory along with all your other files. We have two options:
Option 1: Move index.qmd to root (Recommended)
This follows standard Quarto conventions:
bash# Move index.qmd from report to root
mv report/index.qmd .

# The _quarto.yml stays as we have it, referencing:
# - index.qmd (at root)
# - report/01-question.qmd, etc. (in report directory)
Option 2: Keep everything in report directory
Update _quarto.yml to reference index.qmd in the report directory:
bash# Update _quarto.yml to point to index.qmd in report directory

All the detailed chapters stay organized in the report folder

Which option do you prefer? The error will be fixed either way - we just need the _quarto.yml file to match where your index.qmd actually is!RetryCFwhat about under one, they all in the reportEditPerfect! I can see all your files are in the report directory, including index.qmd. Let's update the _quarto.yml to reflect this structure:

This should fix the "index.qmd not found" error because now the _quarto.yml correctly points to report/index.qmd where your file actually is, rather than looking for it at the root level.
The GitHub Action should now successfully find all your files and build your Quarto book!RetryCFEditI see the new error! It says "Book contents must include a home page (e.g. index.md)". The issue is that Quarto expects the first chapter to be the "home page" and not be in a subdirectory.
