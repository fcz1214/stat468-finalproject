# Problem Statement

Tennis presents a unique challenge for sports prediction because of its individual nature and the 
complex factors that determine match outcomes. Unlike team sports where multiple players can 
compensate for each other's weaknesses, tennis matches come down to head-to-head competition 
between two individuals, making every factor potentially decisive. The sport has always captured 
the attention of fans and analysts who want to understand what makes one player more likely to 
beat another. Traditional tennis analysis often relies on subjective assessments or simple 
win-loss records, but these approaches miss the nuanced patterns that data science can reveal.

This project initially aimed to explore player fatigue during rallies by examining how shot 
speeds decline as rallies extend. The hypothesis was that as rallies progressed beyond five 
or six shots, players would show measurable signs of fatigue through declining shot speeds 
and increased error rates. The plan was to use shot-by-shot data from the Tennis Match 
Charting Project to identify fatigue patterns that could predict when momentum was shifting 
during a match. 

However, after working with the data, it became apparent that the shot speed data was 
inconsistent across different tournaments and recording conditions. More importantly, the 
relationship between speed decline and match outcomes was much weaker than expected. Rather 
than forcing a problematic approach, I decided to pivot to a more established and proven 
methodology.

This shift was influenced by prior research I had encountered during an earlier paper 
presentation, which demonstrated that simple features like player rankings and match context 
could achieve impressive prediction accuracy, often in the 65-70% range. The appeal of this 
approach lies in its combination of simplicity and effectiveness. Instead of trying to capture 
complex within-match dynamics, it focuses on fundamental characteristics: how good each player 
is relative to their opponent, and how match conditions might favor one player over another.

One key constraint was computational resources. Complex models requiring extensive processing 
were not feasible, which aligned well with ranking-based prediction that achieves strong 
performance with simple models. The project also needed to demonstrate practical applicability 
by building a complete system that could serve real-time predictions through a web interface.

The primary objective became building a tennis prediction system that validates existing 
research while demonstrating the full pipeline from data collection to deployment. This 
involves model development, data engineering, API design, web development, and deployment 
automation. The project would be successful if it achieved comparable accuracy to published 
research in the 65-70% range, successfully deployed as a working web application, and provided 
a reproducible, automated pipeline that demonstrates modern data science practices.
