# Transform

With clean tennis data in hand, I needed to transform it into features that a machine learning 
model could actually use. The goal was to create a small set of meaningful variables that 
capture what really matters in tennis: how good each player is relative to their opponent, 
and what the match conditions are like.

The most important feature turned out to be ranking advantage. In tennis, lower rankings are 
better, so rank 1 beats rank 50. I calculated Player 1's advantage by subtracting their rank 
from Player 2's rank. When this number is positive, Player 1 is favored; when negative, 
Player 2 has the edge.

I also added two contextual features that capture important tennis dynamics. First, whether 
both players are in the top 50, since matches between elite players tend to be more 
unpredictable regardless of rankings. Second, whether there's a large ranking gap of 20 or 
more positions, which usually signals a heavily favored outcome.

Court surface needed special handling since it's categorical data. I used hard court as the 
baseline and created separate indicators for clay and grass courts. This lets the model learn 
how different surfaces affect outcomes compared to the most common playing condition.

Creating the target variable required some careful work since different data sources format 
winner information differently. I wrote defensive code that could handle various column 
formats while ensuring I always got a clean binary outcome indicating whether Player 1 won.

The final transformation gave me exactly what I needed: a small, interpretable set of features 
that matches tennis intuition. The ranking advantage captures the fundamental strength 
difference, the contextual features add nuance about match dynamics, and the surface 
indicators account for playing style preferences. Everything remained simple enough to explain 
to users while being sophisticated enough to make good predictions.

This approach meant I could focus on the features that actually matter in tennis rather than 
getting lost in complex feature engineering. The simplicity also made deployment much easier 
since I only needed to collect a few key pieces of information to make predictions.
